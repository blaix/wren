# Wren

I was very slowly trying to build a web development framework with [these goals](https://github.com/blaix/wren/wiki/Goals).

I was using ruby. I like ruby. But I found myself getting distracted by DSLs and crippled by choice.
I decided to start over in python. I'm calling it [woma](https://github.com/blaix/woma).

**This project is abandoned. Please see [woma](https://github.com/blaix/woma).**
