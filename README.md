# Wren

I'm very very slowly trying to build a web development framework with [these goals](https://github.com/blaix/wren/wiki/Goals).

But I can't promise not to abandon this after a deep dive into elixir/phoenix or haskell/yesod.

Not much to see now, but for an idea of where I'm headed with this, check [the 0.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/blaix/wren/milestones/Version%200.1.0).
